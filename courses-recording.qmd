Once you've developed the course curriculum, you're ready to record. Here are some tips to help you do so successfully. 

## Defaults

Please use defaults when you teach. This means having your RStudio set up to look like it would for a student. If you move your panels around, for example, please revert to the default when recording lessons. 

Please also use default fonts while you are teaching. Pretty as they are,
please don't use fonts like [Fira
Code](https://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/ligature-fonts-for-r/),
as the differences in how they render the assignment operator, for
example, can be confusing for newbies.

## Code Style

Please follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) as closely as possible. The most important thing is to have code that is easy to read for new learners. You're welcome to use the [`styler` package](https://styler.r-lib.org/) to format your code.

## Recording Videos

For those on Mac or Windows, recording happens with [Descript](https://www.descript.com/). David will set you up with a license so you can use it.

### Getting Ready to Record

[This image from Egghead](https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/) is an accurate representation of what goes into making videos.

Before you record there are several things to take into consideration. 

**Please tidy whatever portion of your workspace will show in the background of videos**. No need to go 100% Marie Kondo, but please try to keep it neat. Not only does it look more professional, it also encourages people to focus on what you're teaching, not whatever random object is on your bookshelf.

**Please use an external microphone**. Try to keep it as close to you as possible, though I generally try to keep it off screen.

**Adjust your screen resolution**. Adjusting your screen resolution makes your code much easier to read.

Working on a Mac, I go to Settings > Displays and select 1024 x 576 (HiDPI). [As Egghead explains about HiDPI](https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/screen-setup/): 

> HiDPI mode—also known broadly as DPI scaling, or Retina display on Macs—doubles each pixel, allowing for highly readable text on very high-resolution screens.

There are some instructions for doing the same thing on Windows [here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-adjust-high-dpi-scaling-in-windows-10/).

**Please hit the top menu bar when you record**. Please go into full screen mode in RStudio. This hides your top menu bar and keeps the focus on your code.

**Please use an external webcam**. They tend to be higher quality than built-in ones.

### Recording Lessons in Descript

You will record videos using Descript. It's a great tool and has [extensive documentation](https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us).

Please create a new project for each lesson. Use the blue new project button, not the classic project option.

Here's how to record a lesson.

::: {.muse-video-player data-video="Cev4WJs" data-logo="0" data-width="100%"}
:::

You can re-record as much as you'd like. It's helpful if you can delete bad takes that you don't want included. Just highlight the text and hit delete.

## Video Editing

Once you've finished recording all lessons, David will then edit them.
