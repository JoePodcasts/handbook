title: "Data Viz"
---

We do a lot of data viz at R for the Rest of Us. Most of the work we do is for general audiences, or at least for folks not super familiar with data. As a result, our data viz tends to look more like data viz seen in the media rather than like that seen in, say, academia. 

When making data viz for R for the Rest of Us, we abide by three main principles:

1. Highlight
2. Declutter
3. Explain
4. Sparkle

I talk about these principles in a video I made for the [Going Deeper with R course](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/going-deeper/).

<div class="muse-video-player" data-video="mC3j51J" data-links="0" data-logo="0" data-width="100%"></div><script src="https://muse.ai/static/js/embed-player.min.js"></script>

What this means in practice is the following:

We **highlight** important findings using descriptive titles that show what's happening with the data. Things like "90% of people do X" rather than "Percent of people who do X." The rationale for this is laid out in [this article by Stephanie Everegreen](https://stephanieevergreen.com/strong-titles/).

We **declutter** our charts by removing unnecessary elements. Here's an example of such a chart. Note that we have removed most grid lines, and the y axis title. This makes the data easier to read and make sense of.

We **explain** by using annotations where possible.

We make our charts **sparkle** by using custom fonts and custom themes. We have an internal custom theme in the [`rfortherestofus` package](https://rfortherestofus.github.io/rfortherestofus/reference/theme_rru.html). 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rfortherestofus)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                 y = flipper_length_mm,
                 color = species,
                 size = body_mass_g)) +
  labs(title = "Perfectly proportional penguins",
       subtitle = "Just *look* at them go!",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)") +
  guides(size = "none") +
  scale_color_manual(values = rru_colors("Blue", "Orange", "Yellow")) +
  theme_rru()
```


But more often, we create a custom theme for clients we work with. This involves using their fonts and colors. In cases where clients have branding guidelines, we use those. If not, we get colors and fonts from their website and use them.
