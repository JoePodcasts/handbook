Contract + Advance

- David + instructor sign contract and 
- David pays advance to instructor

Set up Infrastructure 

- David sets up shared Google Drive folder 
- David creates Google Sheet for course outline

Develop Outline 

- Explain how lessons work (e.g. video, your turn, solutions, learn more) 

Develop slides 

- David shares rruthemes package to be used
- Instructor develops slides
- David approves slides

Record Videos

- Instructor records single test video 
- David approves test video 
- Instructor records remaining videos, including solutions

Edit videos 

- David's video editor edits videos

Put content on website 

- Final approval from instructor 

Marketing for course launch

- David + instructor develop email sequence 
- David + instructor plan out social media launch

Add content to website 

- Make landing page for course 
- All material added to website

Course launch!


## Legal and Financial

Here are the legal and financial terms that I typically use when working with course instructors. I'm flexible and happy to work with you to come up with a solution that meets both of our needs. 

### Compensation

I pay an advance to the course creator of $500, half on signing the contract to work together, and the other half when all videos for the course are recorded and uploaded to Google Drive.  

Revenue for the courses is split 60/40 (60% for R for the Rest of Us, 40% for the course creator). I pay any royalties owed to the course creator on a quarterly basis. 

### Ownership

All videos are owned by R for the Rest of Us. 

All non-video materials will be made freely available on the R for the Rest of Us organization GitHub using a CC-BY-SA-4.0 License.

### Exclusivity

The instructor agrees not to create a course that covers the same topic on another online platform for at least 12 months from the release of this course. 

### Agreement Expiration

These terms remain in effect for one year after the course is released. After that, David and the instructor will discuss any possible changes to the terms.





## Curriculum Development

You'll develop your curriculum as a combination of slides, exercises,
and examples. Here's how I've used the three, but please note that this
is just my approach. I want you to think about what's going to work best
for your materials.

I start out each section of my course with slides. In my courses, a
section is RMarkdown or data wrangling and analysis or data
visualization. I have a slide with the section title that I display as I
talk through an overview of that section.

Each lesson within a section should be short and focus on a single
topic. As you're making your materials, if you think that a video
demonstrating the concept will go beyond 5 minutes or so, consider
breaking it into multiple lessons.

I typically start a lesson with slides. I'll start with a slide that
lays out the concept. I'll often have code on this slide.

![](images/slide-example.png) I'll usually then flip over to RStudio to
show myself typing out the code to demonstrate this concept in an
exercises file. 

You can see an example of a whole lesson, complete with all parts [here](https://rfortherestofus.com/lessons/group_by/). 

### Lesson Content

I usually use a Google Sheet to help collaborate with the instructor on course materials. [Here's a sample of what the Google Sheet includes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/145ucNRSx1FBUv8I-L6cFS3fHWFH1wZ3jOtpxvWSUn5c/edit?usp=sharing). The Google Sheet has places for thinking about lesson content, data, exercises, solutions, and learn more resources. 


## Course Materials

### GitHub Repo

Each course will have a GitHub repo on the R for the Rest of Us
organization account. David will create this and add you to the repo.

### Project Organization

### Slides

#### Slides Template

Slides for R for the Rest of Us courses are made using the [`xaringan`
package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

There is a custom template to use to make slides in the R for the Rest
of Us style. You can access this by installing the [`rfortherestofus`
package](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rfortherestofus) using the
following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rfortherestofus/rfortherestofus")
```

Please create a slides directory where all of your slides will live.

You can create slides as follows:

#### Slides Organization

Most lessons should have a My Turn and a Your Turn section. The slide for
the My Turn section should have an orange background and the slide for
the Your Turn section should have a dark background.

To do this, add the class `my-turn` and the class `inverse` to your
slides as follows:

## RStudio Setup

### Defaults

Please use default fonts while you are teaching. Pretty as they are,
please don't use fonts like [Fira
Code](https://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/ligature-fonts-for-r/),
as the differences in how they render the assignment operator, for
example, can be confusing for newbies.

## Code Style

Please follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) as closely as possible. The most important thing is to have code that is easy to read for new learners. You're welcome to use the [`styler` package](https://styler.r-lib.org/) to format your code.

## Recording Videos

I record using Screenflow. If you're on a Mac, you'll get a license for it. If not, we'll discuss options. 

### Recording Procedures

I'm generally not that fussy about making sure everything is super high
quality, but please use an external camera and external mic to record.
Please put your mic as close to you as possible, but make sure it
doesn't show up on camera. If you are interested in learning some tips
about high-quality screencasting, [this guide from
Egghead](https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/) is helpful.

My general experience is that it's easier to record videos by just
hitting record and going through your lesson as many times as you need
to. I often make mistakes along the way, but that's ok because we can
edit them out after the fact. Just go back to right before you messed up
and start again! You can, of course, record so you get a single
high-quality take, but I find that hard to do and way too much pressure.

### Sharing Videos with David

Please share the raw videos you record in the Google Drive folder that
David sets up for you. Make sure they are labeled so I know what each
video is.

## Video Editing

David will edit all of your videos.
