## Projects We Take On

In general, consulting projects we take on involve some combination of the following:

- Data visualization
- Layout using RMarkdown and pagedown
- Parameterized reporting

You can see examples of several such projects on the [consulting page of the R for the Rest of Us website](https://rfortherestofus.com/consulting).

## Projects We Don't Take On

Projects that have been less successful for R for the Rest of Us are:

- Ad hoc data analysis
- Lack clear scope and involve "looking to see what data is out there"
