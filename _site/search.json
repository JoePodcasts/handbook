As you’re making your materials, if you think that a video demonstrating the concept will go beyond 5 minutes or so, consider breaking it into multiple lessons.\nI typically start a lesson with slides. I’ll start with a slide that lays out the concept. I’ll often have code on this slide.\n I’ll usually then flip over to RStudio to show myself typing out the code to demonstrate this concept in an exercises file.\nYou can see an example of a whole lesson, complete with all parts here.\n\nLesson Content\nI usually use a Google Sheet to help collaborate with the instructor on course materials.

Please put your mic as close to you as possible, but make sure it doesn’t show up on camera. If you are interested in learning some tips about high-quality screencasting, this guide from Egghead is helpful.\nMy general experience is that it’s easier to record videos by just hitting record and going through your lesson as many times as you need to. I often make mistakes along the way, but that’s ok because we can edit them out after the fact. Just go back to right before you messed up and start again! You can, of course, record so you get a single high-quality take, but I find that hard to do and way too much pressure.\n\n\nSharing Videos with David\nPlease share the raw videos you record in the Google Drive folder that David sets up for you.

This compares the balances in my bank accounts to those in QuickBooks to make sure everything matches up.\nI also pay course instructors each quarter. You can go to the commission report on the website and see which commissions are unpaid. You can total these up for each instructor (they’re called a vendor on this part of the website) and then pay them through Gusto. Each instructor gets an advance so they only start receiving commissions when they earn more than the advance."

Once they’re on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.\nThe specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from Brennan Dunn’s Mastering ConvertKit course. The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here’s what it does:\nBelow are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren’t included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below."

    "text": "Signup\nHere are the signup journeys that users experience on the R for the Rest of Us email list.\n\nGetting Started\nIf the user gets onto the list by signing up for Getting Started, they get the tag Purchased - Getting Started applied through the WooCommerce-ConvertKit integration.\nThey then go through the Getting Started - Signup - Automation. This does the following:\n\nAssigns the tag Customer - Course/Workshop\nAssigns the tag Customer\nAssigns the tag Flag - Calculate Next offer (which sends them through the Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation)\nAssigns the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag, which does what it says\nPuts them through the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, which sends a set of emails about the course\nWhen they complete the course or the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, they get pulled to the end and go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation\n\nThe Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation pitches people on Fundamentals. It happens in two ways depending on what the user has done so far on Getting Started.\n\nIf the user has the Completed - Getting Started tag, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Hot. This goes straight to the pitch for Fundamentals.\nIf the user has not completed Getting Started, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Cold. This sends them a few emails before pitching them on Fundamentals.\n\nAfter they go through the bridge sequences, they go into the Fundamentals - Pitch - Automation.\n\nThe tag Flag - Pitch Window Open - Fundamentals gets applied. This triggers Zapier to create a personalized coupon on WooCommerce.\nThe user gets an email on Friday telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.\nThe user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.\nThe tag Completed - Onboarding is applied.\nThe tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is applied. This triggers the Shadow Newsletter - Automation and adds them to the shadow newsletter.\n\n\n\nOther Courses\n\nIf they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g. Purchased - Fundamentals).\nThen, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g. Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.\n\n\n\nR in 3 Months\n\nIf they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.\nThen, they go through this visual automation, which sends them an email that welcomes them. All other communication about R in 3 Months happens directly via Gmail\n\n\n\nNewsletter\nIf someone signs up for the newsletter using this form, the following happens:\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag is added to them through this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag puts them into the Global - Welcome - Sequence using this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag being added puts them onto the New Subscriber - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Tag Custom Training/Consulting Clients - Automation\n\nIf they are a custom training/consulting client, they get the Completed - Onboarding and the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tags applied, which moves them onto the shadow newsletter\nIf they are not a custom training/consulting client, they are moved to the Getting Started - Pitch - Automation (if they haven’t signed up for it)\n\n\n\n\nYou can do that with R\nNote: This one is basically archived. It was a lead magnet early on but isn’t really necessary anymore because most people sign up for Getting Started.\n\nIf user signs up for you can do that, it happens with this form.\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber."

If not, puts them onto that sequence.
