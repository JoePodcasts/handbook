Once they’re on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.\nThe specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from Brennan Dunn’s Mastering ConvertKit course. The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here’s what it does:\nBelow are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren’t included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below."

    "text": "Email Journeys\n\nSignup\nHere are the journeys that experience on the R for the Rest of Us email list.\n\nGetting Started Signup\nIf the user gets onto the list by signing up for Getting Started, they get the tag Purchased - Getting Started applied through the WooCommerce-ConvertKit integration.\nThey then go through the Getting Started - Signup - Automation. This does the following:\n\nAssigns the tag Customer - Course/Workshop\nAssigns the tag Customer\nAssigns the tag Flag - Calculate Next offer (which sends them through the Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation)\nAssigns the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag, which does what it says\nPuts them through the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, which sends a set of emails about the course\nWhen they complete the course or the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, they get pulled to the end and go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation\n\nThe Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation pitches people on Fundamentals. It happens in two ways depending on what the user has done so far on Getting Started.\n\nIf the user has the Completed - Getting Started tag, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Hot. This goes straight to the pitch for Fundamentals.\nIf the user has not completed Getting Started, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Cold. This sends them a few emails before pitching them on Fundamentals.\n\nAfter they go through the bridge sequences, they go into the Fundamentals - Pitch - Automation.\n\nThe tag Flag - Pitch Window Open - Fundamentals gets applied. This triggers Zapier to create a personalized coupon on WooCommerce.\nThe user gets an email on Friday telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.\nThe user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.\nThe tag Completed - Onboarding is applied.\nThe tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is applied. This triggers the Shadow Newsletter - Automation and adds them to the shadow newsletter.\n\n\n\nOther Courses Signup\n\nIf they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g. Purchased - Fundamentals).\nThen, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g. Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.\n\n\n\nR in 3 Months Signup\n\nIf they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.\n\nTODO Start here\n\nThen, they go through this visual automation, which takes them out of welcome sequences for Fundamentals and Going Deeper because they’ll get more personal emails. I also intentionally don’t assign them the tag Flag - New Subscriber because I want to handle the onboarding in a more personal way.\n\n\n\nNewsletter signup\nIf someone signs up for the newsletter using this form, the following happens:\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag is added to them through this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag puts them into the Global - Welcome - Sequence using this automation rule\n\nThe Flag - New Subscriber tag being added puts them onto the New Subscriber - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation\nThe New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the Function - Tag Custom Training/Consulting Clients - Automation\n\nIf they are a custom training/consulting client, they get the Completed - Onboarding and the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tags applied, which moves them onto the shadow newsletter\nIf they are not a custom training/consulting client, they are moved to the Getting Started - Pitch - Automation (if they haven’t signed up for it)\n\n\n\n\nYou can do that with R signup\nNote: This one is basically archived. It was a lead magnet early on but isn’t really necessary anymore because most people sign up for Getting Started.\n\nIf user signs up for you can do that, it happens with this form.\nThen, this automation rule assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.\n\n\n\n\nSegmentation\n\n\nCalculate Next Offer\n\n\nShadow Newsletter\n\n\nCourse Pitches\n\n\nLive Launches\n\n\nCustom Training + Consulting Pitches"
