<p>Email marketing is the main way that R for the Rest of Us brings in revenue.</p>
<p>All external marketing is designed to get people onto the R for the Rest of Us email list. Once they’re on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.</p>
<p>The specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from <a href="https://createandsell.co/courses/mastering-convertkit">Brennan Dunn’s Mastering ConvertKit course</a>. The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here’s what it does:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Get people onto the list</p></li>
<li><p>Send them a series of welcome emails</p></li>
<li><p>If they’re not signed up for the free Getting Started course (most are), try to get them to sign up for that</p></li>
<li><p>When they complete the Getting Started course or ~2 weeks after they sign up for the list, try to get them to sign up for the Fundamentals course</p></li>
<li><p>Put them onto the “shadow newsletter” (i.e.&nbsp;a series of pre-planned emails they receive every week)</p></li>
<li><p>Every ~3 months, try to sell them on a different paid course</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren’t included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below.</p>
<section id="signup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signup">Signup</h2>
<p>Here are the signup journeys that users experience on the R for the Rest of Us email list.</p>
<section id="getting-started" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>If the user gets onto the list by signing up for Getting Started, <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2816&amp;action=edit">they get the tag Purchased - Getting Started applied through the WooCommerce-ConvertKit integration</a>.</p>
<p>They then go through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547465/edit">Getting Started - Signup - Automation</a>. This does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assigns the tag Customer - Course/Workshop</li>
<li>Assigns the tag Customer</li>
<li>Assigns the tag Flag - Calculate Next offer (which sends them through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/545987/edit">Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation</a>)</li>
<li>Assigns the Flag - Remove from Shadow Newsletter tag, which does what it says</li>
<li>Puts them through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/sequences/744617">Getting Started - Signup - Sequence</a>, which sends a set of emails about the course</li>
<li>When they complete the course or the Getting Started - Signup - Sequence, they get pulled to the end and go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation</li>
</ol>
<p>The Fundamentals - Bridge - Automation pitches people on Fundamentals. It happens in two ways depending on what the user has done so far on Getting Started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the user has the Completed - Getting Started tag, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Hot. This goes straight to the pitch for Fundamentals.</li>
<li>If the user has not completed Getting Started, they go into the Fundamentals - Bridge - Cold. This sends them a few emails before pitching them on Fundamentals.</li>
</ol>
<p>After they go through the bridge sequences, they go into the Fundamentals - Pitch - Automation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The tag Flag - Pitch Window Open - Fundamentals gets applied. <a href="https://zapier.com/editor/106477759/published">This triggers Zapier to create a personalized coupon on WooCommerce</a>.</li>
<li>The user gets an email on Friday telling them their personal window is open to purchase Fundamentals.</li>
<li>The user goes through the Fundamentals - Pitch - Sequence, which sends an email every day the next week with info on purchasing Fundamentals.</li>
<li>The tag Completed - Onboarding is applied.</li>
<li>The tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is applied. This triggers the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547446/edit">Shadow Newsletter - Automation</a> and adds them to the shadow newsletter.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="other-courses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-courses">Other Courses</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g.&nbsp;Purchased - Fundamentals).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g.&nbsp;Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)</p></li>
<li><p>Then, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704">this automation rule</a> assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="r-in-3-months" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-in-3-months">R in 3 Months</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, they go through <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/899958/edit">this visual automation</a>, which sends them an email that welcomes them. All other communication about R in 3 Months happens directly via Gmail</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="newsletter" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="newsletter">Newsletter</h3>
<p>If someone signs up for the newsletter using <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ninja-forms&amp;form_id=3">this form</a>, the following happens:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Flag - New Subscriber tag is added to them through <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704">this automation rule</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Flag - New Subscriber tag puts them into the Global - Welcome - Sequence using <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/2104767">this automation rule</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Flag - New Subscriber tag being added puts them onto the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/545990/edit">New Subscriber - Automation</a></li>
<li>The New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/545987/edit">Function - Calculate Offer Funnel and Expertise Level - Automation</a></li>
<li>The New Subscriber - Automation moves them through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/586488/edit">Function - Tag Custom Training/Consulting Clients - Automation</a>
<ol type="1">
<li>If they are a custom training/consulting client, they get the Completed - Onboarding and the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tags applied, which moves them onto the shadow newsletter</li>
<li>If they are not a custom training/consulting client, they are moved to the Getting Started - Pitch - Automation (if they haven’t signed up for it)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<li><p>Then, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704">this automation rule</a> assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="shadow-newsletter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shadow-newsletter">Shadow Newsletter</h2>
<p>Any time the tag Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter is added to a user, they go through the <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/547446/edit">Shadow Newsletter - Automation</a>. This does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Removes the Flag - Start Shadow Newsletter tag (so it can be added again)</li>
<li>Checks if they’ve completed part 1 of the shadow newsletter. If not, puts them onto that sequence. If so, moves onto the next part.</li>
<li>Repeats the previous step through each part of the shadow newsletter.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the user completes each part of the shadow newsletter, they get the tag Locked - Pitched added. This puts them onto Function - Move to Pitch - Automation.</p>
