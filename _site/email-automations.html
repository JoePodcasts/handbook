<p>Email marketing is the main way that R for the Rest of Us brings in revenue.</p>
<p>All external marketing is designed to get people onto the R for the Rest of Us email list. Once they’re on the list, we send them regular emails that educate them about R, interspersing emails that attempt to sell them on our offerings.</p>
<p>The specifics of how our email marketing system works comes largely from <a href="https://createandsell.co/courses/mastering-convertkit">Brennan Dunn’s Mastering ConvertKit course</a>. The process gets fairly complicated, but at the highest level, here’s what it does:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Get people onto the list</p></li>
<li><p>Send them a series of welcome emails</p></li>
<li><p>If they’re not signed up for the free Getting Started course (most are), try to get them to sign up for that</p></li>
<li><p>When they complete the Getting Started course or ~2 weeks after they sign up for the list, try to get them to sign up for the Fundamentals course</p></li>
<li><p>Put them onto the “shadow newsletter” (i.e.&nbsp;a series of pre-planned emails they receive every week)</p></li>
<li><p>Every ~3 months, try to sell them on a different paid course</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="email-automations" class="level1">
<h1>Email Automations</h1>
<p>Here are details about how email automations work. Note that sequences aren’t included because they are generally just called from Visual Automations below.</p>
<section id="new-subscribers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-subscribers">New Subscribers</h2>
<p>A new subscriber can get on the list in the following ways:</p>
<section id="newsletter-signup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="newsletter-signup">Newsletter signup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>If they sign up for the newsletter through <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ninja-forms&amp;form_id=3">this form</a>, the Ninja Forms action applies the Flag - New Subscriber tag to them.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="you-can-do-that-with-r-signup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="you-can-do-that-with-r-signup">You can do that with R signup</h3>
<p>Note: This one is basically archived. It was a lead magnet early on but isn’t really necessary anymore because most people sign up for Getting Started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If user signs up for you can do that, it happens with <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ninja-forms&amp;form_id=4">this form</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704">this automation rule</a> assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="course-signup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-signup">Course signup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If they sign up for a course, each Woo products assigns them the appropriate tag (e.g.&nbsp;Purchased - Getting Started).</p></li>
<li><p>Then, they go through a visual automation for each course (e.g.&nbsp;Fundamentals - Signup - Automation)</p></li>
<li><p>Then, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/rules#/1977704">this automation rule</a> assigns them the tag Flag - New Subscriber.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="r-in-3-months-signup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-in-3-months-signup">R in 3 Months signup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If they sign up for R in 3, WooCommerce assigns them the tag Purchased - R in 3 Months.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, they go through <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/automations/618611/edit">this visual automation</a>, which takes them out of welcome sequences for Fundamentals and Going Deeper because they’ll get more personal emails. I also intentionally don’t assign them the tag Flag - New Subscriber because I want to handle the onboarding in a more personal way.</p></li>
